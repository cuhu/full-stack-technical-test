### Full Stack Technical Test

##### Task requirements:

Backend:
Create a simple API using Laravel which can output and store reviews for your favourite Movie.
Use seeder data to populate the database or alternatively leverage a third party API if you wish.
The API should have the ability to do the following:

- Retrieve basic data about the movie
- Retrieve a list of reviews
- Store a review for the movie

Frontend:
Create a simple, yet visual appealing UI which displays the movie data and the reviews from your API.
There should also be the ability to submit a new review. Use any javascript framework or patterns you are most comfortable with to complete the task.

The frontend should have the ability to do the following:

- Display the movie data
- List the reviews
- Submit a new review

Consideration should be given for pagination, as well as clean and testable code. Git can also be used to document the progress during the task.
